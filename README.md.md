\# Python Dice Rolling Game



A simple python source-code that rolls two 6-sided dice. 





This project is a simple python command-line project game that helps beginner programmers to practice using while loop, conditionals and also some python modules for example the random module as in this source-code. I coded this project along with a YouTube series on python beginner projects. 





\# How it works:



When you run the program, it asks:

Roll the dice? (y/n)

If you type y or Y, it chooses a random number between 1 and 6 for both dice and prints it like for example (3,5).

If you type n or N, it prints a "Thank you" message.

If you enter anything other than y or n, it prints "Invalid choice!" message on your terminal and asks again.



\# Requirements:



Python 3.x

(*Optional*) VS Code or any other editor



\#How to run:



1. Save the code in a file named dice.py
2. Open a terminal or a command prompt
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved
4. Run the code using the appropriate command for your system, python dice.py(for Windows) or python3 dice.py(for macOS/Linux)



\#Sample Output

Roll the dice? (y/n) y

(2, 6)

Roll the dice? (y/n) y

(1, 4)

Roll the dice? (y/n) %

Invalid choice!

Roll the dice? (y/n) n

Thanks for playing!



\# Learned features

User input handling

Infinite loops with while True

Conditional branching using if, elif, and else

Random number generation with random.randint()

String methods like .strip() and .lower()

Formatted output using f-strings
